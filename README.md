# ⚛️ React Learning Journey 

Welcome to my React learning repository! 🚀

This repository documents my step-by-step journey in mastering frontend development with React. It contains a progression of projects ranging from vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation to a fully functional To-Do Application using React hooks and state management.

## 📂 Project Structure
Here is a breakdown of the modules and what I learned in each:

### 0HTML-CSS-JS (The Foundation)

Concept: Imperative Programming vs. Declarative.

Description: A "Dark Mode" toggle built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Goal: Understanding direct DOM manipulation before switching to React.

### 1CounterProject (Hello Hooks)

Concept: useState Hook.

Description: A simple interactive counter application.

Goal: Learning how to preserve values between renders using React State.

2DarkThemeProject (The React Way)

Concept: Declarative Logic & Conditional Styling.

Description: Refactoring the project from folder #0 into React.

Goal: Managing UI themes (Dark/Light) via State instead of direct class manipulation.

### 3Components (Architecture)

Concept: Component Reusability.

Description: Creating isolated, reusable UI building blocks.

Goal: Understanding the "Lego" philosophy of React architecture.

### 4Props (Data Flow)

Concept: Props (Properties).

Description: Custom buttons that accept dynamic data (text, color, etc.) from the parent component.

Goal: Passing data from Parent to Child components.

### 5List_Map (Rendering Lists)

Concept: .map() & Keys.

Description: Rendering dynamic lists of data (Student Cards) efficiently.

Goal: Understanding how to iterate over arrays and the importance of unique key props.

### 6ToDoApp (Capstone Project)

Concept: CRUD Operations & Array Manipulation.

Description: A fully functional To-Do List application.

✅ Add new tasks (Input handling)

✅ List tasks dynamically

✅ Delete tasks (Filtering arrays)

Goal: Combining State, Props, Event Handling, and Array methods in a real-world scenario.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
Core: React.js, JavaScript (ES6+)

Build Tool: Vite

Styling: CSS3 (Inline Styles & CSS Modules)

State Management: React Hooks (useState)
